# Deep learning based autodelineation of gross tumour volumes and involved nodes in PET/CT images of patients with HNC
This code was used to train the deep learning models used in the paper *Deep learning based autodelineation of gross tumour volumes and involved nodes in PET/CT images of patients with HNC* by Yngve Mardal Moe, et al.

The datasets should be structured as HDF5 files, with one group for each dataset split.
